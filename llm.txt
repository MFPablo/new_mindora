# New Mindora Platform Information

A modern mental health platform monorepo built with Bun, Hono, Vite, and React.

## Tech Stack
- **Runtime**: Bun (v1.2.4+)
- **Monorepo Management**: Turborepo
- **Backend**: Hono (Node runtime / Bun)
- **Database / ORM**: Prisma (SQLite for development)
- **Frontend**: React 19, Vite
- **Routing**: TanStack Router (File-based)
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4, Google Material Symbols
- **Authentication**: Auth.js (via @hono/auth-js)
- **Testing**: Playwright (E2E)

## Project Structure
- `/client`: React frontend application. Uses file-based routing in `src/routes`.
- `/server`: Hono backend API. Main logic in `src/index.ts`.
- `/shared`: Shared types, Zod schemas, and utility functions.
- `/e2e`: Playwright end-to-end tests.
- `/server/prisma`: Database schema and seed data.

## Key Architectural Patterns
- **Authentication Middleware**: Centralized JWT decoding and session extraction in `server/src/index.ts` middleware.
- **Role-Based Access Control**:
    - Backend: `roleGuard` middleware to restrict `/api/patient/*` and `/api/professional/*` endpoints.
    - Frontend: `requireAuth` utility in `client/src/lib/auth-guard.ts` for route protection in TanStack Router's `beforeLoad`.
- **Booking System**: Interactive calendar with anticipation logic (blocks slots within X hours of current time) and dynamic availability fetching.
- **Crisis Support**: Global "SOS" floating button in the patient dashboard for immediate emergency contacts.

## Commands
- `bun run dev`: Start both client and server in development mode.
- `bun run build`: Build the entire workspace.
- `bun run test`: Run all tests.
- `bun run initiate`: Initialize database (migrate and seed).
- `npx playwright test`: Run E2E tests.

## Conventions
- Use `es` locale for date formatting (Spanish).
- Icons follow Google Material Symbols syntax (e.g., `<span class="material-symbols-outlined">...</span>`).
- Components prioritize modern "premium" aesthetics with dark mode support.
